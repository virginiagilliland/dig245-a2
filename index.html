    <h2>Opening a Candy Bar: How to View the HTML Source of a Webpage in Chrome:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your favorite website, mine is currently
          <a href="https://www.hikingproject.com/">Hiking Project</a>.
          Imagine the part of the website you can see as the wrapper,
          and we want to get to the candy itself - the source code.</li>
        <li>Next, right click anywhere on the webpage</li>
        <li>Select "inspect" from the dropbdown box that appears. This will
        allow you to access the source code - the candy bar itself!</li>
        <li>A new panel with the HTML source code will appear</li>
        <li>If you cannot view the code, make sure "Elements" is
          selected from the list of options across the top of the panel</li>
      </ol>
